# NPC Randomizer

This is a lightweight simple tool that generates only the species customization values, species type, gender and hair are the only things not randomly generated.
This tool is used with Bori's npc maker tool, it just provides a method of not having to log into the game and customize an NPC yourself.
There are sliders below that allow you to see the min/max of the customization values so if you wish to manually edit you can do so.

## Notes

Manipulating the sliders before generating doesn't apply - however you can see what the min/max are for that particular value and modify it afterwards.

You'll need to use Bori's NPC maker exe and save the generated values into a .npc file for that tool to convert it.
